React is an amazing library for building frontend applications. I have used React to build applications of different sizes, but there's been one specific issue that I have always been faced with - React is very unopinionated. Now that's not inherently a bad thing at all. Being unopinionated about how to do things in a react app gives you the flexibility to create a good structure that suites you, your team, and your project - but it gets very terrible when you build a large project with no definite structure in place!

After countless hours spent building large applications with React, and getting to a point where making changes became very difficult (sometimes even impossible) because of the poor architecture. I did some research and came up with a better way to architect large and scalable frontend applications with React. 

This repo contains the structure that I will use in future react projects. Take a look at it!

Also, there are READMEs in each top-level and some low-level folders that give some meaningful descriptions.
